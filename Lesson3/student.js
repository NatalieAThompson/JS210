// Write a program to determine a studentâ€™s grade based on the average of 
// three scores you get from the user. Use these rules to compute the grade:

//     If the average score is greater than or equal to 90 then the 
//     grade is 'A'
//     If the average score is greater than or equal to 70 and less 
//     than 90 then the grade is 'B'
//     If the average score is greater than or equal to 50 and less 
//     than 70 then the grade is 'C'
//     If the average score is less than 50 then the grade is 'F'

// You may assume that all input values are valid positive integers.
